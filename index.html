                She sits up high, surrounded by the sun
                One million branches and she loves every one
                <p class="highlight">Mom and dad, did you search for me?<br>I've been up here so long, I'm going crazy</p>
                And as the sun went down
                We ended up on the ground
                I heard the train shake the windows
                You screamed over the sound
                And as we own this night
                I'll put your body to the test with mine
                <p class="highlight">love was out of control<br>Three, two, one, where did it go?</p>
                Now don't be crazy, yes, now of course you can stay here
                Been in a touring band for going on ten years
                "Big deal," she said, "I guess you're official"
                I only said it 'cause I know what it's like to feel burned out
                It gets you down, we've all been there sometimes
                But tonight I'll make you feel beautiful once again
                And as the sun went down
                We ended up on the ground
                I heard the train shake the windows
                You screamed over the sound
                And as we own this night
                I'll put your body to the test with mine
                This love was out of control
                Three, two, one, where did it go?
                <p class="highlight">If I were you, I'd put that away<br>See, you're just wasted and thinking 'bout the past again<br>Darling, you'll be okay</p>
                And she said
                <p class="highlight">"If you were me, you'd do the same<br>'Cause I can't take anymore<br>I'll draw the shades and close the door<br>Everything's not alright, and I would rather"</p>
                And as the sun went down
                We ended up on the ground
                I heard the train shake the windows
                You screamed over the sound
                And as we own this night
                I'll put your body to the test with mine
                <p class="highlight">This love was out of control<br>Tell me, where did it go?</p>
